# simple-functions-c
This is a compendium of stand alone simple functions for c/c++. Most of them were created during my degree at Seneca College.

They are NOT part of school assignments,but little snippets of code that I create to make my life easier. :)

IF YOU ARE A STUDENT: do not pass this as your work. Part of the joy of learning it to learn how things work. This can only be accomplished if you put effort in your own work.
